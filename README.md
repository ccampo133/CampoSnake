My C# .NET implementation of Snake!  Use the arrow keys to move.  Apples give 100 points and increase the snake size by 1, while oranges give 300 points and decrease the snake size by 3 (unless your snake is only 3 units long; in that case oranges just give 300 points).  All fruit is cleared every 20 seconds, but a new piece spawns every 3 seconds.  Additionally, eating fruit slightly increases the rate at which the fruit spawns, so the more you eat, the quicker they re-appear!

### CONTROLS
P or PAUSE - pause game

ARROW KEYS - move snake
